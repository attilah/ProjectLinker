#ProjectLinker tool for Visual Studio 2010

This is the original Patterns & Practices Project Linker tool updated for today's developer tools.

I grabbed the latest sources, then I made these modifications:
  - Added a workaround for Solution Folders.
  - Default buttons assigned for the dialogs where needed to make it more user friendly.
  - Created a VSIX project.
  - Added support for VS11 Beta.

If you like to use this find the prebuilt binary in the Build directory.

Have fun!
